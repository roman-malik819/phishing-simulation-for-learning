# Introduction to Project

## Project Title:
**Simulated Facebook Login Clone for Phishing Awareness**



## Objective:
This project presents a simulated phishing attack using a cloned version of the Facebook login page. It is designed purely for educational purposes as part of a study in ethical hacking and cybersecurity awareness.



## Project Description:
The project involves creating a static clone of the Facebook login interface to demonstrate how phishing attacks are executed by malicious actors. The intent is to help learners and security enthusiasts understand the structure, tactics, and appearance of phishing pages â€” and thereby improve their ability to recognize and defend against real-world attacks.

This simulation:
- Does not send or collect real data.  
- Is hosted and tested locally only.  
- Is meant for authorized environments, such as ethical hacking labs or cybersecurity courses.



## Key Features:
- Realistic Facebook login UI (HTML/CSS only)
- Local credential capture simulation (for awareness, not misuse)
- Demonstrates how attackers trick users with visual imitation
- Educational comments within the code to explain key parts



## Ethical & Legal Notice:
This project is strictly for learning purposes under the discipline of ethical hacking. It must not be used to deceive, collect real credentials, or perform attacks in real environments.

Any such use is illegal and against the intent of this project.

I take no responsibility for misuse. This simulation is safe for academic environments, CTF events, or personal cybersecurity training.
